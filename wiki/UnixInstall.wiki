== Building from the tarball ==

To build Spek, download the source code tarball then run these commands from terminal:

{{{
% tar -xjvf spek-0.x.tar.bz2
% cd spek-0.x
% ./configure
% make
}}}

To build you will need GTK+ and FFmpeg packages. On Debian/Ubuntu you also need development packages: libgtk2.0-dev, libavcodec-dev and libavformat-dev. For MP3 support you will need FFmpeg compiled with restricted codecs. On Ubuntu you can install ubuntu-restricted-extras. On Debian you can use FFmpeg from [http://debian-multimedia.org/ Debian Multimedia]. On Fedora you need ffmpeg-devel from rpmfusion-free-updates.

Also note that Ubuntu's FFmpeg is very outdated, you might need to install it from a third-party [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas?name_filter=ffmpeg PPA] or [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=786095 from svn].

To start Spek, run:

{{{
% src/spek
}}}

Or install it with:

{{{
% sudo make install
}}}

== Building from the git repository ==

{{{
% git clone git://gitorious.org/spek/spek.git
% cd spek
% ./autogen.sh
% make
}}}

In addition to the packages listed above, you will need autotools and the Vala compiler (normally packaged as valac).
