To build Spek, download the source code tarball then run these commands from terminal:

{{{
$ tar -xjvf spek-0.x.tar.bz2
$ cd spek-0.x
$ ./configure
$ make
}}}

You will need GStreamer and GTK+ packages installed to build. On Debian/Ubuntu you will also need development packages: libgstreamer0.10-dev and libgtk2.0-dev.

To start Spek, run:

{{{
$ src/spek
}}}

Or install it with:

{{{
$ sudo make install
}}}
