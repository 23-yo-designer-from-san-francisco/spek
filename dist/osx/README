Building the OS X bundle
========================

Install and configure [jhbuild][1] and [ige-mac-bundler][2].

Get the release tarball and unpack it somewhere. Also copy the tarball to ~/gtk/source/pkgs/.

Add this line to ~/.jhbuildrc-custom:

  moduleset=os.environ['HOME'] + 'path/to/spek/dist/osx/spek.modules'

Run:

  $ jhbuild build spek
  $ jhbuild shell
  $ dist/osx/bundle.sh

Note: On Lion, built in libiconv conflicts with the bundled version. To work around, accompany all jhbuild commands with `--skip=libiconv` so that everything uses the system version of the library (see issue 51).
